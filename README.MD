# KeySync

KeySync is an Android app that allows users to play games using an external keyboard and mouse without requiring root access. It leverages [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku) to grant necessary permissions and maps key events from external input devices to on-screen touch points.

## Features

- ðŸŽ® **Keyboard & Mouse Support** - Play mobile games with a keyboard and mouse.
- ðŸ”„ **No Root Required** - Uses Shizuku for permission handling instead of rooting.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Custom Key Mapping** - Map keyboard/mouse events to specific touch points on the screen.
- ðŸŽ­ **Anti-Detection Mechanism** - Introduces randomness in mapped touches to prevent detection by anti-cheat systems.
- ðŸ”§ **Configurable Settings** - Customize mappings for different games and control layouts.
